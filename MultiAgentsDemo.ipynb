      "  - The company name or ticker symbol (AVGO) for querying news articles.\n",
      "  - Python code to interact with the NewsAPI to fetch relevant articles.\n",
      "- **Milestone:** Retrieve up to 5 articles about AVGO from reputable sources.\n",
      "\n",

      "  - Internet connection to access yfinance library.\n",
      "  - A valid ticker symbol: AVGO.\n",
      "  - Python code to fetch stock data, including stock prices and trading volume.\n",
      "- **Milestone:** Obtain stock performance data, ensuring to retrieve data between December 11, 2024, to January 8, 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Analyze Information\n",
      "**Objective:** Compile and analyze information from both the news articles and stock data.\n",
      "- **Substeps:**\n",
      "  - Review articles to identify key recent events and market sentiment.\n",
      "  - Analyze stock price trends, volume, and any notable fluctuations.\n",
      "- **Milestone:** Identify connections between news events and stock performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Write the Financial Report\n",
      "**Objective:** Compile findings into a structured financial report.\n",
      "- **Sections of the report:**\n",
      "  1. **Introduction:** Brief overview of AVGO.\n",
      "  2. **Recent Events:** Summary of news articles and key events.\n",
      "  3. **Stock Performance:** Analysis of stock data highlighting trends and significant changes.\n",
      "  4. **Conclusion and Recommendation:** Provide a recommendation based on combined insights from news and stock data.\n",
      "- **Milestone:** Finalize and organize content for the financial report.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Saving the Report\n",
      "**Objective:** Ensure the financial report is saved as a markdown file.\n",
      "- **Requirements:** Instructions to save the final report as a markdown file.\n",
      "- **Milestone:** Successful saving of the report in the desired format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Monitoring Progress\n",
      "- After each step is completed, review gathered data for completeness and accuracy.\n",
      "- Ensure that any insights or data anomalies are addressed before moving to subsequent steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling Failures\n",
      "- **If API fails:** Check the API key, endpoint URL, and network connection. If the service is unavailable, seek alternative sources.\n",
      "- **If data anomaly:** Verify data accuracy against another source if possible, or reconsider the time frame of data collection.\n",
